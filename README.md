# Project-Futura
rmmv project (WiP)

##What are the plans?
> The main design goal is to create an advanced singleplayer experience in an vibrant gameworld. the player can anytime drop in to the mainstory or dropout and go playing sidequests or exploring the world. there will be no region restrictions. player want go to that dungeon when he is level 5? but the dungeon is optimized for level 35? go for it. the player has the control at any time. but for this main design goal the game also needs an advanced help or tutorial that extends when the player explore the game more and more. a vibrant world needs also much space (in rmmv called maps) and much to do. explore, sidequests, smalltalk with that old man at the fishing dock.... technically is this design goal a challenge. a city needs much npc's to be vibrant. this will need a lot of optimizing and testing. but testing should be taken externally by internal testers. also one goal is to have the game two languages. english and german. with this goal we create an experience that can be played by much more people at a time. but it will be an offline experience. at any time the game will not connect to a server. all assets are local saved on the players computer and can be accessed at any time.
